;; PgBouncer User List
;; Format: "username" "password"
;; The password should be MD5 hash: "md5" + md5(password + username)
;; Or for plaintext (not recommended): "username" "password"
;;
;; Generate MD5 password with:
;; echo -n "passwordusername" | md5sum
;; Then prepend "md5" to the hash
;;
;; Example:
;; "myuser" "md5d8578edf8458ce06fbc5bb76a58c5ca4"

;; Admin user (replace with your actual credentials)
"postgres" "md5[your-md5-hash-here]"

;; Application users
;; Note: For Supabase, you typically use service role key or JWT authentication
;; This file is mainly for direct PostgreSQL connections

;; IMPORTANT: Keep this file secure and out of version control
;; Use environment variables or secrets management in production
